R code for analyzing what acoustic features people are using when they say a speaker is more breathy or more creaky. Analysis makes use of residual H1* acoustic measure. Analysis consists of Random Forest Analysis.

Uses ```renv``` to manage packages for reproducibility. After the project folder is downloaded run ```renv::restore()``` in the R console to restore the project to a similar state I used when conducting the analysis.
